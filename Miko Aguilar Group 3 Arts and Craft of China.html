<p>Throughout the ages, the Chinese have used lanterns not only as sources of light or simple paper decoration, they symbolize vitality, social status and good luck. Around the world, the round, red lantern remains one of the most easily recognized trademarks of Chinese culture. On the whole, they consist of a frame made of metal wire or bamboo strips covered with paper, silk or thin gauze and then painted over to be attractive. Paper lanterns do not last very long, they soon break, and silk lanterns last longer. In their simplest form, they are simply a paper bag with a candle placed inside, although more complicated lanterns consist of a collapsible bamboo or metal frame of hoops covered with tough paper.<p>

<p>Tie-dyeing is a traditional textile dyeing technique in the Southwest China, which is done by the ethnic people in Yunnan and Guizhou Province. This method appeared in the 3rd to 4th century in China and is still used today. The craft of tie-dyeing is a precious legacy in Zhoucheng Village in Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan. Its population is only about 10,000 and there are more than 6,000 people employed in the tie-dyeing business. Due to its fine workmanship, Zhoucheng has become the main producing place of the tie-dyed cloth, known as 'the Land for National Tie-dye. The tie-dyed materials are usually are white cotton cloth or a blended fabric of cotton and flax, and the dye is mainly made from indigo plants. The main tools used are jars and sticks. The procedures include designing, painting, tying with thread, diping-dyeing, removing thread, poaching and trimming.</p>

<p>Chinese Bonsai (called Penzai or Penjing in Chinese), inspired by nature, was originated in China around 1300 years ago. It is an art of designing miniature trees or flowers in a shallow pot or container. Chinese Bonsai can be classified into several groups according to their sizes, places of origin, and the different art styles. In the old time, bonsai was practiced only by the elites as a symbol of social statues. Around 1100 AD when some Buddhist monks brought the Chinese Bonsai to Japan, the art was adopted by the Japanese. It was not until the early 1900’s that Chinese Bonsai spread to the rest of the world. Chinese Bonsai encourages plant to flow in a natural way. The original function of Bonsai is not just as a kind of decoration or to re-create nature in a pot, but to actually capture the spirit of Feng Shui. Old Chinese think that the universe has two sides of cosmic energy, which is called the Yin and the Yang, and plants are divided into the Yin or the Yang. According to their need, owner of a house chooses bonsai plants to make up the balance of the house. Bonsai producing areas throughout China have their own genres of designing bonsai. Famous bonsai producers in China include the Shanghai Botanic Gardens with over 150 Bonsai gardens, Suzhou, which has the Humble Administrators Garden (listed as a World Heritage Site), and Hangzhou Botanic Garden which is famous for its two-and-a-half acre Bonsai garden where growing 3,500 Bonsai plants.</p>

<p>Chinese calligraphy, also called Shu fa in Chinese is regarded as a traditional art of writing which is existed in Asian cultures. In the history of Chinese art, calligraphy has always been held in equal importance to painting. The calligraphy artists are capable of producing variety styles and forms of Chinese characters by controlling the concentration of ink, the thickness of the paper and the flexibility of the brush. What’s interesting to western people is, diffusing ink blots and dry brush strokes are viewed as a natural impromptu expression rather than a fault. To the artist, calligraphy is a mental exercise that coordinates the mind and the body to choose the best styling in expressing the content of the passage. Tools used to produce Chinese characters are reputed as Four Treasures of the Study - brush, paper, ink stick and ink stone. On the basis of function, brushes are classified into three groups: hard, soft and both. Brush handles are usually made of bamboo, wood, lacquer or porcelain. Brushes made of ivory or jade are rare and precious, presenting the owner’s social statue. The paper used for writing calligraphy has to be soft and fine textured, suitable for conveying the artistic expression of both Chinese calligraphy and painting.</P>
